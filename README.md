This Java project is a media product management system. It utilizes a singleton design pattern to create a StockerManager class that is responsible for reading and writing to the inventory files, as well as updating prices of items and retrieving inventory data.

### Usage

This project was developed using Java Dev Kit version 21. In order to run this code you will need to have JDK 21 selected as you Java Runtime Environment within your IDE. 

We have provided a test Main.java to perform many of the operations provided, however, if you would like to create your own main you can just create it within the package and use it instead.

To run within any file just hit play!

### Dependencies

An example csv is within the files folder. It should be noted that the file path is hard coded as a constant within the singleton class. If you wish to test different data you will need to change that file path. The implementation also expects a specific csv format and will only work with that format.
